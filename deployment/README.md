# terraform-module-knfsd

This directory contains a [Terraform Module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) for deploying a Knfsd cluster on Google Cloud.

**Note:** The `main` branch may be updated at any time with the latest changes which could be breaking. You should always configure your module to use a release. This can be configured in the modules Terraform Configuration block.

```
source = "github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knfsd-cache-utils//deployment/terraform-module-knfsd?ref=v0.4.0"
```

## Prerequisites

Before deploying a Knfsd Cluster in Google Cloud, you should make sure the following prerequisites are met.

| Prerequisite                                                                   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| [Knfsd Disk Image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images#custom_images) | You must have followed the steps in the [/image](/image) directory to build a Knfsd Image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Firewall Rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls)                  | This module only creates the firewall rules for [healthchecks](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/health-check-concepts#ip-ranges) (this can be disabled). You must make sure you implement the firewall rules required for NFS Communication between:<br /><br /> - Knfsd --> Source NFS Server<br /> - Render Clients --> Knfsd |
| [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)                                 | You should have [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) installed and configured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)                           | You should have Terraform 0.12 or above installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If you **do not** currently use Terraform, follow [this guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) to download and install it.

## Metrics

These deployment scripts can optionally configure the exporting a range of metrics from each Knfsd Node into [Google Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations) (formerly Stackdriver). These are exported via the [Stackdriver Monitoring Agent](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/agent) which is installed as part of the [build scripts](/image).

These metrics can be enabled via the `ENABLE_STACKDRIVER_METRICS` Terraform Variable as detailed below. **If you wish to use auto-scaling then metrics must be enabled**.

The following additional prerequisites must be met if you wish to enable metrics:

| Prerequisite                                                                                                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| [Metric Descriptors and Dashboard Import](metrics)                                                                       | If this is the first time you are deploying Knfsd in a Google Cloud Project you need to setup the Metric Descriptors and import the Knfsd Monitoring Dashboard. This is achieved via a standalone Terraform configuration and the process is described in the [metrics](metrics) directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Private Google Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access)                               | You must have [Private Google Access](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access) enabled on the subnet that you will be using for the Knfsd Nodes. This is required to allow connectivity to the Monitoring API for VM's without a Public IP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Service Account Permissions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#service_account_permissions) | A Service Account needs to be configured for the Knfsd Nodes with the `logging-write` and `monitoring-write` scopes. This is performed automatically by the Terraform Module when you have metrics enabled. By default, the [Compute Engine Default Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account) will be used. <br><br>You need to make sure the Service Account you create for Terraform has the `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` role on the Compute Engine Default Service Account so that it can assign it to the Knfsd Nodes. This is covered in the "Generating a Service Account" section below. |

The following custom metrics are exported currently:

| Metric Name                                                    | Description                                                                                                     |

### Dashboards

The Knfsd Monitoring Dashboard is created automatically by the metrics initialisation Terraform that is detailed in the [Metrics Prerequisites](#metrics).

Once ran, you can then access the dashboard from [https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/)

## Autoscaling

**Important: To use Autoscaling you MUST have metrics enabled as they are used as a scaling metric**

The Knfsd Deployment Scripts also support configuring AutoScaling for the Knfsd Managed Instance Group. Scaling based on the standard metric of CPU Usage is not optimal for the caching use case. Instead the custom metric `custom.googleapis.com/knfsd/nfs_connections` is used for triggering an autoscaling event.

Autoscaling can be enabled by setting the `ENABLE_KNFSD_AUTOSCALING` environment variable to `true` (defaults to `false`). There are also some other configuration options detailed in the [Configuration Variables](#configuration-variables) section below such as how many NFS Connections a Knfsd node should be handling before a scale-up.

To avoid interruptions to existing NFS client mounts, and by extension render operations the autoscaler behaviour is set to **SCALE UP ONLY**. When a Knfsd Client exceeds the number of connections defined in the `KNFSD_AUTOSCALING_NFS_CONNECTIONS_THRESHOLD` variable a new instance will be added to the Knfsd Managed Instance group. If the number of Knfsd Connections subsequently falls significantly the Knfsd cluster **will not** automatically scale down. This is not a GCP limitation but an intentional design consideration to avoid:

- Loss of FS-Cache data that would need to be re-pulled on scale up
- Interruption to existing NFS Client Connections

You can change this behaviour if you wish, but it is not recommended.

There is a slight delay for metric ingestion (1-2 mins) and then for a new node to spin up and initialise (~2 mins). When a scaling event occurs new traffic will continue to be sent to the existing healthy nodes in the cluster until there is a new node ready to handle the connections. It is therefore recommended that you set your `KNFSD_AUTOSCALING_NFS_CONNECTIONS_THRESHOLD` slightly lower than the maximum number of connections a single Knfsd node can handle. This will start the scaling event early and make sure a new node is ready before your existing nodes become overloaded.

## Knfsd Agent

By default, each Knfsd node will also run the [Knfsd Agent](../../image/knfsd-agent/README.md). This is a small Golang application that exposes a web server with some API Methods. Currently the Knfsd Agent only supports a basic informational API method (`/api/v1.0/nodeinfo`). This method provides basic information on the Knfsd node. It is useful for determining which backend node you are connected to when connecting to the Knfsd Cluster via the Internal Load Balancer.

Over time this will API will be expanded with additional capabilities.

This agent listens on port `80` and can be disabled by setting `ENABLE_KNFSD_AGENT` to `false` in the Terraform.

For information on the API Methods, see the [Knfsd Agent README.md](../../image/knfsd-agent/README.md).

## Usage

**Note: See the [Configuration Variables](#Configuration-Variables) section for advance configuration options**

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```terraform
module "nfs_proxy" {
    source = "github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knfsd-cache-utils//deployment/terraform-module-knfsd?ref=v0.4.0"

    # Google Cloud Project Configuration
    PROJECT                        = "my-gcp-project"
    REGION                         = "us-west1"
    ZONE                           = "us-west1-a"

    # Network Configuration
    NETWORK                        = "my-vpc"
    SUBNETWORK                     = "my-subnet"
    AUTO_CREATE_FIREWALL_RULES     = false
    LOADBALANCER_IP                = "10.67.4.5"

    # Knfsd Proxy Configuration
    PROXY_IMAGENAME                = "knfsd-base-image"
    EXPORT_MAP                     = "10.0.5.5;/remoteexport;/remoteexport"
    PROXY_BASENAME                 = "rendercluster1"
    KNFSD_NODES                    = 3
}

// Prints the IP address of the Load Balancer
output "load_balancer_ip_address" {
    value = module.nfs_proxy.nfsproxy_loadbalancer_ipaddress
}

// Prints the DNS address of the Load Balancer
output "load_balancer_dns_address" {
    value = module.nfs_proxy.nfsproxy_loadbalancer_dnsaddress
}
```

Edit the above [configuration variables](#Configuration-Variables) to match your desired configuration.

### Provider Default Values

The Terraform module also supports supplying the project, region and zone using provider default values. Set the project, region, and/or zone properties on the Google Terraform provider. Omit these properties from the module.

```terraform
provider "google" {
  project     = "my-gcp-project
  region      = "us-west1"
  zone        = "us-west1-a
}

module "nfs_proxy" {
    source = "github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knfsd-cache-utils//deployment/terraform-module-knfsd?ref=v0.4.0"

    # Network Configuration
    NETWORK                        = "my-vpc"
    SUBNETWORK                     = "my-subnet"
    AUTO_CREATE_FIREWALL_RULES     = false
    LOADBALANCER_IP                = "10.67.4.5"

    # Knfsd Proxy Configuration
    PROXY_IMAGENAME                = "knfsd-base-image"
    EXPORT_MAP                     = "10.0.5.5;/remoteexport;/remoteexport"
    PROXY_BASENAME                 = "rendercluster1"
    KNFSD_NODES                    = 3
}
```

### Generate Service Account

**If you are using [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell), or a local workstation with [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud) installed and authenticated then you can skip this step and instead comment out the `credentials` field in the Terraform Google Provider to make Terraform use your credentials. Your account will need a minimum of the permissions described below**

You will need to generate a [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) that Terraform can use to deploy resources in your Google Cloud Project.

This can be achieved with the following commands (these should be run in the same directory as the `deploy.tf` file):

```
GOOGLE_PROJECT=<YOUR PROJECT ID>
gcloud config set project $GOOGLE_PROJECT
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $GOOGLE_PROJECT --format 'value(projectNumber)')
gcloud iam service-accounts create terraform-deployment-sa --description="Service Account for Terraform Knfsd Deployment"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GOOGLE_PROJECT --member serviceAccount:terraform-deployment-sa@$GOOGLE_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role='roles/compute.admin'
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create service-account-key.json --iam-account terraform-deployment-sa@$GOOGLE_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

If you are using metrics you should also run the below additional commands:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com  --member="serviceAccount:terraform-deployment-sa@$GOOGLE_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountUser'
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GOOGLE_PROJECT --member serviceAccount:terraform-deployment-sa@$GOOGLE_PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role='roles/monitoring.admin'
```

Create or update the Google provider in Terraform to use the service account key file:

```terraform
provider "google" {
  credentials = file("service-account-key.json")
}
```

**Warning: The service-account-key.json should be stored securely - do not commit to Git or share with any unauthorised party**

### Deploy Knfsd

Once you have created your `deploy.tf` and created your Service Account you can deploy Knfsd with:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

| PROXY_BASENAME                  | A nickname to use for this Knfsd deployment (used to ensure uniquely named resources for multiple deployments).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | False                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `nfsproxy`      |
| EXPORT_MAP                      | A list of NFS Exports to mount from on-premise and re-export in the format `<SOURCE_IP>;<SOURCE_EXPORT>;<TARGET_EXPORT>`.<br><br> For example to mount `10.0.0.1/export` from on-premise and re-export as `10.100.100.1/reexport` you would set the `EXPORT_MAP` variable to `10.100.100.1;/export;/reexport`.<br><br>You can specify multiple re-exports using a comma, for example `10.100.100.1;/assets;/assetscache,10.100.100.1;/textures;/texturescache`. | `EXPORT_MAP`, `EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT` or `DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP` must be set. You can set `EXPORT_MAP` in conjunction with `DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP` but you should not set it in conjunction with `EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT` | N/A             |
| EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT         | A list of IP addresses or hostnames of NFS Filers that respond to the `showmount` command. Knfsd will automatically detect and re-export mounts from this filer. Exports paths on the cache will match the export path on the source filer.<br><br> You can specify multiple filers using a comma, for example `10.100.100.1,10.100.200.1`.                                                                                                                     | `EXPORT_MAP`, `EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT` or `DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP` must be set. Do not set `EXPORT_MAP` or `DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP` if using `EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT`                                                        | N/A             |
| DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP          | The same as `EXPORT_MAP` but NFS Exports specified via this variable will have crossmounts automatically discovered and re-exported. Workaround to the issue described in [this thread](https://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=161653016627277&w=2). Specifying re-exports via this option will have a small performance impact on cache initialisation as it involves performing a `tree` on each export. This option can be set alongside `EXPORT_MAP`.             | `EXPORT_MAP`, `EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT` or `DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP` must be set. You can set `DISCO_MOUNT_EXPORT_MAP` in conjunction with `EXPORT_MAP` but you should not set it in conjunction with `EXPORT_HOST_AUTO_DETECT` | N/A             |
| EXCLUDED_EXPORTS                | A list of export paths excluded from auto-discovery (comma separated). Auto-discovery will ignore any mounts using these paths. Can be used to ignore protected paths such as `/bin`. Does not apply to mounts specified in the `EXPORT_MAP`. Paths excluded from auto-discovery can be explicitly exported using `EXPORT_MAP`, this can be used to change the export path.                                                                                     | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `""`            |

| MIG_MAX_UNAVAILABLE_PERCENT     | The maximum number of instances that can be unavailable during automated MIG updates ([see docs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/rolling-out-updates-to-managed-instance-groups#max_unavailable)). Defaults to 100% to ensure consistent cache instances within the MIG.                                                                                                                                                                  | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `100`           |
| MIG_REPLACEMENT_METHOD          | The instance replacement method for managed instance groups. Valid values are: `RECREATE`, `SUBSTITUTE`.<br><br>If `SUBSTITUTE` (default), the group replaces VM instances with new instances that have randomly generated names. If `RECREATE`, instance names are preserved. You must also set `MIG_MAX_UNAVAILABLE_PERCENT` to be greater than 0 (default is already `100` so this only applies if you have modified this variable).                         | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `SUBSTITUTE`    |
| MIG_MINIMAL_ACTION              | Minimal action to be taken on an instance. You can specify either RESTART to restart existing instances or REPLACE to delete and create new instances from the target template. If you specify a RESTART, the Updater will attempt to perform that action only. However, if the Updater determines that the minimal action you specify is not enough to perform the update, it might perform a more disruptive action.                                          | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `RESTART`       |

## Caveats

### Limitations on export names

The proxy cannot re-export paths that match standard Linux system directories such as `/bin`, `/dev`, `/usr/local/lib`, etc.

While some NFS servers may support creating an export with at path such as `/bin`, attempting to re-export the path via the cache would result in the cache overlaying its local `/bin` directory with the mount.

Also included in the list of protected directories is the `/home` directory. This is because some commands such as `gcloud compute ssh` will look for ssh keys in the home directory, and may create user home directories and ssh keys within the home directories. To prevent this undesired, and unexpected behaviour the `/home` directory is not supported.

The proxy will fail to start if it attempts to export a protected path. Check the logs for errors such as:

> startup-script: ERROR: Cannot mount 10.0.0.2:/home because /home is a system path

If you are providing a manual export list, specify a different path for the export, such as `10.0.0.2;/home;/mnt/home`.

If you're using auto-discovery add the path to the list of excluded exports, for example `EXCLUDED_EXPORTS = "/home,/dev"`.
